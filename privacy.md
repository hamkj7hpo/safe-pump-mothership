## Stealth Airdrop Vault

Every successful swap **permanently and silently** adds your wallet to the on-chain **Stealth Airdrop Vault**.

- Only your public key is stored (32 bytes)
- Duplicates are automatically prevented
- Maximum: 80,000 unique wallets
- You cannot opt out — loyalty is permanent
- Distribution occurs only when the Council signs with BLS
- No explorer can read the vault contents

You swapped.  
You’re in.  
Forever.
